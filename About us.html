    <p>BTCC was established and characterized as NGO in middle of 2003 in Mazar-e Sharif, a northern province in Afghanistan. 

        The aim of this NGO was to supply construction materials to Construction companies from neighborhood countries and to work with local and international organizations in construction projects. Later on at the beginning of 2005 this NGO was registered as a Construction Company and entered to construction field for bidding and successfully accomplished and completed many construction projects with high quality within a time frame. BTCC is a young and dynamic construction company with experienced personnel, machinery and equipment.  </p>

            One of our company’s strongest personality traits is commitment. We are committed to our clients, our team members, our industry and to each other. Commitment is a trait that all the best teams and their members must possess. 

 

It was our commitment to each other and our clients that allowed us to stay together while many companies reduced their staff. We know that our committed staff has been the key to our client relationships and our exceptional service. So instead of reducing staff, we found other alternatives to reduce our overhead costs while never sacrificing our commitment to our customers. In fact, we added services and hired new talented people. We strengthened our preconstruction and construction management services. We accelerated our business development efforts because we knew the economy would improve. 

 

As we head into our 8th year, we are confident that the year ahead will be our biggest and best year to date. I am so proud of our entire team. I can’t wait to see the results and the satisfaction of our new and existing clients.</p>
